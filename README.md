# Introduction to Observables and RxJS
My slides for Introduction to observables and rxjs for Elixir Elm Meetup Aarhus, september 10 2018.

Install the dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

The branch `attempt` contains the filled in versions of the examples. The branch `master` is the presentation without filled in examples.

The examples without an `.html`-file are meant to be run using NodeJS. Run it like this:

```
node 4.js
```

The examples with corresponding `.html` file are meant to be run in the browser. Some of them use the console, some of them use the DOM.
