# Observables

## Key features

- A functional programming style: We transform data and isolate side effects
- Observables are lazy (unlike promises)
- The streams can be composed into complex chains
- An amazing toolbox of functions to combine, create and filter streams

## The reactive thought model: 

- Programming with async data streams
- We can create data streams of anything:
- We react to a datasource, transform the emitted data, and then subscribe and do side effects

## Used where:

- Integrated in the Angular (2+) framework
- Used in React/Redux if you use redux-observable
- Used in recompose for React for creating streaming components
- In CycleJS which builds an entire framework from the observable pattern
- A lot of other places (ReactiveX is cross-language)
