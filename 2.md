# Key features of the observable pattern and RxJS

- RxJS has a functional programming style, where we transform data and isolate side effects
- Observables are lazy (unlike promises)
- The streams can be composed into complex chains, but they don't do anything until we subscribe to them
- The thought model is that we react to a datasource, transform the emitted data, and then subscribe and do side effects

## Used where:

- Integrated in the Angular (2+) framework
- Used in React/Redux if you use redux-observable
- Used in recompose for React for creating streaming components
- In CycleJS which builds an entire framework from the observable pattern
- A lot of other places (ReactiveX is cross-language)
