# Observables

## Key features

- A functional programming style: We transform data and isolate side effects
- Observables are lazy (unlike promises)
- Rich set of operators (map, filter, etc.)
- The streams can be composed into complex chains

## The thought model: 

- We react to a datasource, transform the emitted data, and then subscribe and do side effects
- Observables are tiny simple building blocks

## Used where:

- Integrated in the Angular (2+) framework
- Used in React/Redux if you use redux-observable
- Used in recompose for React for creating streaming components
- In CycleJS which builds an entire framework from the observable pattern
- A lot of other places (ReactiveX is cross-language)
